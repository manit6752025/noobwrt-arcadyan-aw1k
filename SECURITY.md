# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Noobwrt is currently under active perfection. Security support will follow the latest stable release and development branch.

| Version               | Supported          |
| --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Latest stable release | :white_check_mark: |
| Development (`main`)  | :white_check_mark: |
| Older releases        | :x:                |

Security support for development builds may depend on the severity of the issue and whether the affected component is already considered production-ready.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

For vulnerabilities affecting QuantumGrid OS, please use GitHub's private security reporting mechanism:

**GitHub → Security → Advisories → Report a vulnerability**

When reporting an issue, please include:

* A clear description of the vulnerability
* The affected QuantumGrid OS version or commit
* The affected component or package
* Steps required to reproduce the issue
* Any relevant logs, configuration, screenshots, or proof-of-concept information
* The potential security impact
* A suggested mitigation, if known

Please provide enough information for the issue to be reproduced and investigated.

## Response Process

We will make a reasonable effort to:

1. Acknowledge a vulnerability report.
2. Investigate and reproduce the issue.
3. Determine its severity and affected versions.
4. Develop and test a fix where practical.
5. Release or document the appropriate mitigation.
6. Publish a security advisory when disclosure is appropriate.

Response and remediation times may vary depending on the severity, complexity, affected hardware, and whether the issue involves QuantumGrid code or an upstream dependency.

## Scope

Security reports may include vulnerabilities in:

* Noobwrt services
* Noobwrt web interface
* OS APIs
* Authentication and session handling
* SSH and management controls
* Management ACLs
* Network security components
* QuantumGrid packages
* Firmware/build integration
* Wi-Fi configuration and management
* Cellular/5G management
* System update mechanisms

Noobwrt incorporates upstream software such as OpenWrt and other open-source components. Vulnerabilities that originate entirely in an upstream project should also be reported to the appropriate upstream security team where applicable.

## Responsible Disclosure

Please allow reasonable time for investigation and remediation before publicly disclosing a vulnerability.

We appreciate responsible security research and will make a good-faith effort to work with researchers to understand and resolve reported issues.

## Security Updates

Security fixes will be included in supported releases whenever practical.

Release notes and security advisories will identify affected versions and recommended upgrade or mitigation steps when appropriate.
